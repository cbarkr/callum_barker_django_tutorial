## DB
### Commands
#### Shell
`python manage.py shell`
### Relationships
#### Notation
Use double underscores (`__`) to separate relationships

---
## URL Dispatching
### Patterns
#### Converter
Determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path
##### Example
`int`
#### Path Name
Defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern
##### Example
`question_id`
#### Notation
`<<type>:<var-name>>` 
##### Example
`path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail")`

---
## Security
### CSRF Tag
- Cross Site Request Forgeries
- Use ``{% csrf_token %}`` tag in form

---
## Queries / ORM
### Models
#### Create
`instance = ModelName()`
#### Read
##### QuerySet
- Collection of objects from DB
- Basically a select statement
- Get QuerySets using model's Manager (each model has >= 1 Manager - called `objects` by default)
##### Filter methods
- `all()`: Returns entire QuerySet
- `filter()`: Returns objects matching given parameters
- `exclude()`: Returns objects **not** matching given parameters
- Note: Each method returns a QuerySet, and can thus be chained
##### Get methods
- `get()`: Return object matching given parameter(s)
	- Will raise an exception if there are multiple objects returned
- `filter()`: Same as above, can be used like `get()` so long as only one object is returned
##### Other methods
- `annotate()`: Returns objects, each annotated with a list of query expressions
- `order_by()`: Returns objects ordered by given parameter(s)
- `values()`: Returns dictionaries rather than model instances (when used as an iterable)
- `select_related()`: Returns QuerySet that follows FK relationships (single operation)
- `prefetch_related()`: Returns QuerySet that automatically retrieves related objects for each of the specified lookups (single batch - multiple operations)
##### Limiting
Use Python list slicing syntax
- Example: `Entry.objects.all()[:5]`
- NOTE: NEGATIVE INDEXING NOT SUPPORTED
- NOTE: STEP INDEXING NOT SUPPORTED
##### Selecting
Use Python list indexing syntax
- Example: `Entry.objects.all()[0]`
#### Update
- `instance.field = newValue`
- Same goes for FK fields
##### Many-to-many
- `instance.field.add(instanceOfOtherModel)`
- `add()` takes any number of arguments (i.e. if you wanna add multiple many-to-many FK relations, stack them in a single `add()` call)
#### Save
`instance.save()`
#### Delete
`instance.delete()`

---
## Related
Stop the deluge of database queries that is caused by accessing related objects
### `select_related()`
- Creates join, includes related object in select statement
- Limited to single-valued relationships - FK and 1-1
### `prefetch_related()`
- Does separate lookup for each relationship, "joins" in Python
- Allows prefetch of many-many, many-1, and generic relations which cannot be done w `select_related()`
- Must be restricted to homogeneous set of results
- If you have an iterable of model instances, you can prefetch related attributes on those instances using the `prefetch_related_objects()` function
- Chaining `prefetch_related` calls will accumulate the lookups that are prefetched. To clear any `prefetch_related` behavior, pass `None` as a parameter
- You can chain `select_related()` with `prefetch_related()` to reduce overall queries in some circumstances
```
>>> Restaurant.objects.select_related("best_pizza").prefetch_related("best_pizza__toppings")
```

## Field Lookups
Arguments to `filter()`, `exclude()`, `get()`, etc.
### Syntax

#### Field
Name of the field
#### Space
Double underscore
#### Lookuptype
Methods for matching
- `exact`: An exact match

- `startswith`, `endswith`: Self explanatory
- `in`: Self explanatory
- `gt`: Greater than
- `gte`: Greater than or equal to
- `lt`: Less than
- `lte`: Less than or equal to
- `range`: Self explanatory
- `date`: Datetime fields (note: use `datetime.date()` stuff from Python)

#### Value
The value to match with
